MBK Church is one of the parishes with a comfortable church in West Jakarta
It is a very beautiful sightseeing tour
Good
I am very disappointed with the system that is too rigid in this parish
"Recently, I asked a priest for the service of the Sacrament of Anointing the Sick, but the secretariat was too strict based on the region assistant priest"
The parish secretary had just spoken to the priest over the intercom and suddenly said that the father was not there
Shouldn't this Sacrament be prioritized over the existing system? Is there a rule in the Code of Canon Law which stipulates that the administration of the Sacrament of Unction must be in accordance with the priest accompanying the region?
"It's the best, there's ac, there's already a tv and sound system"
Good

"Motorcycle parking is sufficient, but the car park only fits about 10 cars"

"It is the DPH's duty to find a way to maintain this, either adding more holy mass session or separate the segments"
But still the traffic is very bad
"As a father, I also feel the church is not children friendly"
Why? The children room is too small and cramped without a nice view
"And if we just go in the public space, people will see us with sinister looks even if our children is not too noisy"
"So, we cannot bring children to the church huh? How can they be a good catholic later? Thanks to those genius we are not feeling welcome to join the mass"
"Anyways the church is grand, if possible let less people use private cars, the traffic is bad in weekdays and dont make it worse in weekend"

"Many activities, including sunday school"
A nice Catholic church in West Jakarta
"Do not understand how the government could name the street ""Jalan Karmel Raya"" after the Conggregation name (Carmel)"
Ok
The church is big enough
"I don't know the maximum capacity but worry not, when there is big mass like easter or christmas they provide extra seating with roof tent"
The church already equiped with air con
"If you bring children and you're afraid to disturb your neighbor, you can seat in the kids section in the left side of the church"
It is separated by glass (so you can still see the mass) and sound proof
"Thouh with so many people,the problem is parking space (no matter how big a parking space, in jakarta it will always be not enough) and the possibility of traffic jam"
They serve weekly masses in saturday (16
30 and 19
00) and sunday (6
"30, 09"
"00, 11"
"30, 16"
"30, and 19"
00); and daily morning masses at 6 am
Right now they're conducting a renovation in the altar section
I don't know when it will finish
